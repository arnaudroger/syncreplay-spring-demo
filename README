This is a test Java/Spring application for experimenting with the proposed
PostgreSQL feature "synchronous replay".  It is intented to show that the
semantics provided can be used to good effect by a typical software
development stack.

The application is a simple RESTful key/value store, which can be accessed
like so:

 $ curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: text/plain" -d 'b' localhost:9000/key-value/a
 {"key":"a","value":"b"}
 $ curl localhost:9000/key-value/a
 {"key":"a","value":"b"}

The goal is that GET requests should be sent to randomly chosen read-only
replica database servers, PUT requests should go to the primary database
server.  GET requests should see the most recently PUT value for any key at
all times (no replication lag), and failing replica database servers should
have a limited impact on the primary server.

Here is some Python pseudo-code that shows a crude example of the sort of
retry and rerouting behaviour that I think is needed:
